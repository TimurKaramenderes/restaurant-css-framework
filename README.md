# Roast - Brusseleir coffee bar

For this work, I exploit different bootstrap features. In 4 days, I made this little site from scratch to start my understanding of this framework.

The site is articulated around 4 fictitious tabs:
- the welcome and an explanation of the concept
- contact with a form
- a menu
- info on the location of the bar
- a photo gallery

## 1. What's "Roast"?
**Roast** is a concept that I realized and invented a few months ago for a project in Brussels but that never saw the light of day. So I decided to develop the website around this fictitious project to give life to all this visual identity and allow me to almost interfere in a real project by using the graphic assets I had created for the occasion. 

All the artworks are mine, you will simply find some royalty free images reworked on photoshop to illustrate the subject.


## 2. Language
The site is mainly built around the *BOOTSTRAP* framework although you will find some CSS and JS for the navbar (my first algo by the way! :happy:)

## 3. Process
For this particular work, no particular creative process was put in place apart from the discovery of the language. However, I found that establishing a roadmap beforehand was much more obvious.

You will therefore find on my next presentation repositories (for website creation) figmas and mindmappings adapted. This is what I will focus on for my next jobs.

## 4. A few words
If you discovered this repo, thanks for taking the time to check out my work! I'm in a learning phase and it's important for me to see a clear and positive evolution through the months that go by.
